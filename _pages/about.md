Hello, I am Raiyaan Abdullah from Dhaka, Bangladesh. I have completed my undergraduate degree in Robotics and Mechatronics Engineering. Currently, I am seeking Ph.D. admission for Fall 2023. My main research interests are in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision. I am curious about their applications in Activity Recognition, Video Understanding, Smart Health, and Medical Imaging. Especially the introduction of vision transformers and their usage in supplanting traditional CNNs in various domains fascinate me.

  International Robot Olympiad (IRO) is a prestigious olympiad in robotics participated by children aged 6-18 years worldwide. I had the opportunity to mentor the young talents from my country. My responsibilities involved overseeing their progress, assisting them with programming and hardware issues and teaching them to overcome critical challenges. In 2019, the 15-member team won a gold, two silver and six bronze medals with a technical award. In 2021, the 16-member team won four gold, two silver and five bronze medals with four technical awards.
