I am a third year PhD student at the Center for Research in Computer Vision (CRCV), UCF, under the supervision of Dr. Yogesh Singh Rawat. My work focuses on computer vision, with an emphasis on video understanding and action recognition. While models such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Grok, Qwen, InternVL, etc., have achieved remarkable success in text and image analysis, their performance on video tasks still requires improvement. My approach is to identify potential failure cases and weaknesses, curate specialized datasets to evaluate these models and propose methods to improve their accuracy. I believe that advancing video understanding is essential as we move towards AGI.
