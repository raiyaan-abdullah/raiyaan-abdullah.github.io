Welcome to my website. I am a PhD student at the University of Central Florida, where I have been conducting research since Fall 2023 under the supervision of Dr. Yogesh Singh Rawat. My work focuses on computer vision, with an emphasis on video understanding and action recognition. While models such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude and Grok have achieved remarkable success in text and image analysis, their performance on video tasks remains underexplored. My approach is to identify their failure cases, curate specialized datasets to evaluate the latest models and propose methods to improve their accuracy. I believe that advancing video understanding is essential as we move towards AGI.

  International Robot Olympiad (IRO) is a prestigious olympiad in robotics participated by children aged 6-18 years worldwide. I had the opportunity to mentor the young talents from my country. My responsibilities involved overseeing their progress, assisting them with programming and hardware issues and teaching them to overcome critical challenges. In 2019, the 15-member team won a gold, two silver and six bronze medals with a technical award. In 2021, the 16-member team won four gold, two silver and five bronze medals with four technical awards.
