As part of an AI lab project, a Self Solving 8-Puzzle was created that uses A* search algorithm with Manhattan distance and mismatched tiles as heuristic. Along with the simulation, a hardware model of the board was fabricated and the tiles were moved according to the solution steps using a CNC and an electromagnet.
