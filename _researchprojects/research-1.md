An elderly care system is implemented consisting of various modules. The first module enables the elderly person to take their medicine properly by implementing a medicine consumption system. The second module provides them instructions to perform exercise and provides feedback about its quality. It is shown how Spatio-Temporal Polychromatic Trajectory (STPT) images can be obtained from recorded videos and fed to a CNN to detect quality. The third module is an automated moving table that can detect the elder person and follow him around the house.
